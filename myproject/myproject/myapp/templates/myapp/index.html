	<h1>CSS-0: A Fast Predictor of Protein Binding Energy at a Proteomic Scale</h1>
</div>

		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p>CSS-0 is a web server that calculates binding energy of a protein-protein interaction using the protein complex structure. Here a simple mean-field approach is employed to achieve accuracy and speed simultaneously.</p>
		<p>The mean-field scoring function is generated by the PPI.CSS scheme, which optimizes a scoring function with respect to a given dataset by iteratively adding and removing energy term candidates. In CSS-0, we compiled 22 energy term candidates consisting of a contact energy term represented by the Î¼-potential score, as well as accessible salvation area terms. Optimization with respect to a general protein binding energy benchmark leads to the final scoring function, composed of only 4 simple energy terms.</p>
		<p>Despite its simplicity, the function turns out to be considerably reliable in predicting experimental binding energy of a protein complex. Also, CSS-0 shows its desirable performance in reproducing biologically relevant results when applied to a proteomic database.</p>
		<p>For details of the method, please refer to the following paper:</p>

		<!--<p>High-throughput prediction and scoring of protein-protein interactions are essential for understanding the design principles that govern the evolution of an interactome. Here, we propose a new computational scheme (Protein-Protein Interaction: Construction Scheme for a Scoring function, abbreviated as PPI.css) to generate a model predicting binding energy of a given protein complex structure. This scheme presents the &ldquo;landscape scanning&rdquo; technique to determine the final form of a scoring function. Even without structural optimization, which consumes most of computational cost, the final PPI.css model shows a desirable performance on predicting docking energy of various protein complexes. Application to proteomic data shows that transient complexes can be distinguished according to whether they are inhibitory or regulatory, while both types have the similar numbers of interface contacts.
